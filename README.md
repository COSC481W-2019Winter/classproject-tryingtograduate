Mission Statement:
To develop technology that will streamline the alert delivery system for small businesses.

Problem:
Overextended small business owners are looking for a low-cost solution to the problem of quickly and efficiently deploying a group 
alert message containing information such as, office schedule changes, inclement weather, and other time sensitive notifications.

Our team intends to solve this problem by developing a web-based app that will allow a user to sign up for an account and create 
staff groups within that account with whom they wish to communicate.
